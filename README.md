## About Us 

E-Commerce Web App is a platform designed for easy and efficient buying and selling. Our goal is to provide a seamless, secure, and user-friendly experience for both shoppers and sellers.

Powered by Express.js and MongoDB, the app offers smooth navigation, secure payments, product management, and customer reviews. Sellers can easily manage their listings, and buyers can explore a range of products through a dynamic, responsive interface.

## Problem Statement
 Building an E-Commerce Web Application as it provides a hands-on approach to mastering front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end technologies (Express.js, MongoDB). The goal is to create a platform with essential features like product management, user authentication, and secure payments while exploring key concepts like RESTful APIs, DOM manipulation, and UI/UX design. This project offers practical experience in full-stack development, security, and scalability, helping in applying and solidifying our understanding of modern web technologies
